            <p>We create simplified and interactive learning experiences.
                Learning programming should be easy to understand and available for everyone, everywhere!
                Programming Zone is a school for programmers, covering all the aspects of software development.</p>
            <p>Programming Zone originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to
                online content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms.
                The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2021 and elated by the response it generated, we worked our
                way to adding fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and allied articles
                on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing to academics and much more.</p>
            <p>Our content and resources are freely available and we prefer to keep it that way to encourage our readers acquire
                as many skills as they would like to. We donâ€™t force our readers to sign up with us or
                submit their details either. No preconditions and no impediments. Simply Easy Learning!</p>
